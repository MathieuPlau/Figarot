# Figarot â€“ The Mischievous Maestro of Your Raspberry Pi ðŸŽ¶

A tiny Flask-powered daemon with a big personality. Figarot plays sounds, talks back, and brings your Pi to life with flairâ€”whether itâ€™s a jingle, a dramatic entrance, a groovy sample, or just a sarcastic comment in French. Built for fun, designed for flexibility, and unafraid to make noise, Figarot is your perfect buddy to add joy (and a little chaos) to your openspace.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Figarot is a lightweight Python project that lets you trigger sound samples straight from your web browser.

- Organize your sound samples in folders.
- Set the sample path in `config.py` using `SAMPLE_PATH`.
- Sample files are available here: [MathieuPlau/samples](https://github.com/MathieuPlau/samples) as a submoduleâ€”but feel free to use your own!
- Run `run.py` to launch the daemon.
- Flask will start a web serverâ€”youâ€™ll get the address in your terminal.

Thatâ€™s it. Open the browser. Push the buttons. Make noise. Enjoy.
